# tetris-neurovolution
Custom evolutionary algorithm that searches for weights for neural-network connections. The network is evaluating fitness functions of every move (so it has 1 output) based on tetris board statistics line bumpiness, holes or the next piece (next tetrino), so it has 5 inputs (maybe there will be more inputs in the fina version).
